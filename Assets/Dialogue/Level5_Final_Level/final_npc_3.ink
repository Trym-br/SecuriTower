What do you think you're doing?#audio;event:/VO/Wizard/vo_wizzard_anger

Eeee!!!!!!!#speaker;Princess#layout;right
What do you think <i>you're</i> doing?!
Get out!

Excuse me?#speaker;Wizard#layout;left#audio;event:/VO/Wizard/vo_wizzard_confused
This is my room!#audio;event:/VO/Wizard/vo_wizzard_annoyed
This is MY tower!#audio;event:/VO/Wizard/vo_wizzard_annoyed

Ohh.#speaker;Princess#layout;right
Ooohh!!
I was so confused!!
Haha.
So you're the one that used to live here, huh?
A pleasure!
As you can see, I've been doing some renovations!
Honestly, this tower is kinda ugly...
So I'm redecorating!
No need to thank me.

What?#speaker;Quintus#layout;left#audio;event:/VO/Wizard/vo_wizzard_confused
No no, I'm kicking you out.#audio;event:/VO/Wizard/vo_wizzard_default
No renovations! My tower is fine!#audio;event:/VO/Wizard/vo_wizzard_annoyed
Leave!#audio;event:/VO/Wizard/vo_wizzard_anger

Huh?#speaker;Princess#layout;right
I think you're a bit confused.
This is my tower now!
The current housing crisis has made it sooo hard to aquire towers.
It's, like, <i>such</i> a bother.
And I've always wanted a tower for a summer home!
You can imagine the struggle that's caused me.
Luckily, I found this one!
A bit shabby, but with some work it'll do just fine.
I'm sure you can find somewhere else!

Youâ€“?#speaker;Quintus#layout;left#audio;event:/VO/Wizard/vo_wizzard_confused
No!#audio;event:/VO/Wizard/vo_wizzard_default
You cannot just waltz in on someone's property and claim to own it.#audio;event:/VO/Wizard/vo_wizzard_default

Hm?#speaker;Princess#layout;right
Yes I can.
The key was just lying in the mail box.
So it was really easy, actually.
Your pet rock is soo cute, BTW!!!
The maid girl is kinda weird though... I think I'll get rid of her.

Absolutely not.#speaker;Quintus#layout;left#audio;event:/VO/Wizard/vo_wizzard_anger
You're not getting rid of anyone.#audio;event:/VO/Wizard/vo_wizzard_annoyed
You are going to leave, <b>right now</b>.#audio;event:/VO/Wizard/vo_wizzard_annoyed

Hmm...#speaker;Princess#layout;right
Nuh-uh.

Alright.#speaker;Quintus#layout;left#audio;event:/VO/Wizard/vo_wizzard_default
Abooga babooga... Alakazam... Lorem ipsum!!!#wordSpeed;0.06#audio;event:/VO/Wizard/vo_wizzard_spell_s
